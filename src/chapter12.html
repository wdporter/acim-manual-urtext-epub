<p>This is a question everyone must ask. Certainly peace seems to be impossible here. Yet the Word of God promises other things that seem impossible, as well as this. His Word has promised peace. It has also promised that there is no death; that resurrection must occur; that rebirth is manʹs inheritance. The world you see cannot be the world God loves, and yet His Word assures us that He loves the world. Godʹs Word has promised us that peace is possible here, and what He promises can hardly be impossible. But it is true that the world must be looked at differently, if His promises are to be accepted. What the world is, is but a fact. You cannot choose what this should be. But you can choose how you would see it. Indeed, you must choose this.</p>

<p>Again we come to the question of judgement. This time, ask yourself whether your judgement or the Word of God is more likely to be true. For they say different things about the world, and things so opposite that it is pointless to try to reconcile them. God offers the world salvation; your judgement would condemn it. God says there is no death; your judgement sees but death as the inevitable end of life. Godʹs Word assures you that He loves the world; your judgement says it is unlovable. Who is right? For one of you is wrong. It must be so.</p>

<p>The text explains that the Holy Spirit is the Answer to all problems you have made. These problems are not true, but that is meaningless to those who believe in them. And everyone believes in what he made, for it was made by his believing it. Into this strange and paradoxical situation — one without meaning and devoid of sense, yet out of which no way seems possible — God has sent His Judgement to answer yours. Gently His Judgement substitutes for yours. And through this substitution is the un-understandable made understandable. How is peace possible in this world? In your judgement it is not possible, and can never be possible. But in the Judgement of God what is reflected here is only peace.</p>

<p>Peace is impossible to those who look on war. Peace is inevitable to those who offer peace. How easily, then, is your judgement of the world escaped. It is not the world which makes peace seem impossible. It is the world you see that is impossible. Yet has Godʹs Judgement on this distorted world redeemed it and made it fit to welcome peace. And peace descends on it in joyous answer. Peace now belongs here, because a Thought of God has entered. What else but a Thought of God turns hell to Heaven merely by being what It is? The earth bows down before Its gracious Presence, and It leans down in answer to raise it up again. Now is the question different. It is no longer, “Can peace be possible in this world?”, but instead, “Is it not impossible that peace be absent here?”.</p>
