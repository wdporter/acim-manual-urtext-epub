<p>The teachers of God have no set teaching level. Each teaching–learning situation involves a different relationship at the beginning, although the ultimate goal is always the same: to make of the relationship a holy relationship, in which both can look upon the Son of God as sinless. There is noöne from whom a teacher of God cannot learn, so there is noöne whom he cannot teach. However, from a practical point of view he cannot meet everyone, nor can everyone find him. Therefore, the plan includes very specific contacts to be made for each teacher of God. There are no accidents in salvation. Those who are to meet will meet, because together they have the potential for a holy relationship. They are ready for each other.</p>

<p>The simplest level of teaching appears to be quite superficial. It consists of what seem to be very casual encounters: a chance meeting of two apparent strangers in an elevator, a child who is not looking where he is going running into an adult “by accident”, two students who happen to walk home together. These are not chance encounters. Each of them has the potential for becoming a teaching–learning situation. Perhaps the seeming strangers in the elevator will smile to one another; perhaps the man will not scold the child for bumping into him; perhaps the students will become friends. Even at the level of the most casual encounter, it is possible for two people to lose sight of separate interests, if only for a moment. That moment will be enough. Salvation has come.</p> 

<p>It is difficult to understand that levels of teaching the universal course is a concept as meaningless in reality as is time. The illusion of one permits the illusion of the other. In time, the teacher of God seems to begin to change his mind about the world with a single decision, and then learns more and more about the new direction as he teaches it. We have covered the illusion of time already, but the illusion of levels of teaching seems to be something different. Perhaps the best way to demonstrate that these levels cannot exist is simply to say that any level of the teaching–learning situation is part of Godʹs plan for Atonement, and His plan can have no levels, being a reflection of His Will. Salvation is always ready and always there. Godʹs teachers work at different levels, but the result is always the same.</p>

<p>Each teaching–learning situation is maximal in the sense that each person involved will learn the most that he can from the other person at that time. In this sense, and in this sense only, we can speak of levels of teaching. Using the term in this way, the second level of teaching is a more sustained relationship, in which, for a time, two people enter into a fairly intense teaching–learning situation and then appear to separate. As with the first level, these meetings are not accidental, nor is what appears to be the end of the relationship a real end. Again, each has learned the most he can at the time. Yet all who meet will someday meet again, for it is the destiny of all relationships to become holy. God is not mistaken in His Son.</p>

<p>The third level of teaching occurs in relationships which, once they are formed, are lifelong. These are teaching–learning situations in which each person is given a chosen learning partner who presents him with unlimited opportunities for learning. These relationships are generally few, because their existence implies that those involved have reached a stage simultaneously in which the teaching–learning balance is actually perfect. This does not mean that they necessarily recognise this: in fact, they generally do not. They may even be quite hostile to each other for some time, and perhaps for life. Yet should they decide to learn it, the perfect lesson is before them and can be learned. And if they decide to learn that lesson, they become the saviours of the teachers who falter and may even seem to fail. No teacher of God can fail to find the Help he needs.</p>
