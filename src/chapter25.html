<p>In the ultimate sense, reïncarnation is impossible. There is no past nor future, and the idea of birth into a body has no meaning either once or many times. Reïncarnation cannot, then, be true in any real sense. Our only question should be, “Is the concept helpful?”. And that depends, of course, on what it is used for. If it is used to strengthen the recognition of the eternal nature of life it is helpful indeed. Is any other question about it really useful in lighting up the way? Like many other beliefs, it can be bitterly misused. At least, such misuse offers preöccupation and perhaps pride in the past. At worst, it induces inertia in the present. In between, many kinds of folly are possible.</p>

<p>Reïncarnation would not, under any circumstances, be the problem to be dealt with now. If it were responsible for some of the difficulties the individual faces now, his task would still be only to escape from them now. If he is laying the groundwork for a future life, he can still work out his salvation only now. To some there may be comfort in the concept, and if it heartens them its value is self‐evident. It is certain, however, that the way to salvation can be found by those who believe in reïncarnation and by those who do not. The idea cannot, therefore, be regarded as essential to the curriculum. There is always some risk in seeing the present in terms of the past. There is always some good in any thought which strengthens the idea that life and the body are not the same.</p>

<p>For our purposes, it would not be helpful to take any definite stand on reïncarnation. A teacher of God should be as helpful to those who believe in it as to those who do not. If a definite stand on it were required of him, it would merely limit his usefulness as well as his own decision‐making. Our course is not concerned with any concept that is not acceptable to anyone, regardless of his formal beliefs. His ego will be enough for him to cope with, and it is not the part of wisdom to add sectarian controversies to his burdens. Nor would there be an advantage in his premature acceptance of the course merely because it advocates a long‐held belief of his own.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly emphasised that this course aims at a complete reversal of thought. When this is finally accomplished issues such as the validity of reïncarnation become meaningless. Until then they are likely to be merely controversial. The teacher of God is therefore wise to step away from all such questions, for he has much to teach and learn apart from them. He should both learn and teach that theoretical issues but waste time, draining it away from its appointed purpose. If there are aspects to any concept or belief that will be helpful, he will be told about it. He will also be told how to use it. What more need he know?</p>

<p>Does this mean that the teacher of God should not believe in reïncarnation himself, or discuss it with others who do? The answer is, certainly not. If he does believe in reïncarnation, it would be a mistake for him to renounce the belief unless his Internal Teacher so advised. And this is most unlikely. He might be advised that he is misusing the belief in some way which is detrimental to his pupilʹs advance or his own. Reïnterpretation would then be recommended because it would be necessary. All that must be recognised, however, is that birth was not the beginning and death is not the end. Yet even this much is not required of the beginner. He need merely accept the idea that what he knows is not necessarily all there is to learn. His journey has begun.</p>

<p>The emphasis of this course always remains the same: it is at this moment that complete salvation is offered you, and it is at this moment that you can accept it. This is still your one responsibility. Atonement might be equated with total escape from the past and total lack of interest in the future. Heaven is here. There is nowhere else. Heaven is now. There is no other time. No teaching that does not lead to this is of concern to Godʹs teachers. All beliefs will point to this if properly interpreted. In this sense it can be said that their truth lies in their usefulness. All beliefs that lead to progress should be honoured. This is the sole criterion this course requires. No more than this is necessary.</p>
