<p>Indeed, yes! No one can escape God’s final judgement. Who could flee forever from the truth? But the final judgement will not come until it is no longer associated with fear. One day each one will welcome it, and on that very day it will be given him. He will hear his sinlessness proclaimed around and around the world, setting it free as God’s final judgement on him is received. This is the judgement in which salvation lies. This is the judgement that will set him free. This is the judgement in which all things are freed with him. Time pauses as eternity comes near, and silence lies across the world that everyone may hear this judgement of the Son of God:</p>

<blockquote>
Holy are you, eternal, free and whole,<br />
At peace forever in the Heart of God. <br />
Where is the world, and where is sorrow now?
</blockquote>

<p>Is this your judgement on yourself, teacher of God? Do you believe that this is wholly true? No, not yet, not yet. But this is still your goal; why you are here. It is your function to prepare yourself to hear this judgement and to recognise that it is true. One instant of complete belief in this, and you will go beyond belief to Certainty. One instant out of time can bring time’s end. Judge not, for you but judge yourself and thus delay this final judgement. What is your judgement on the world, teacher of God? Have you yet learned to stand aside and hear the Voice of Judgement in yourself? Or do you still attempt to take His role from Him? Learn to be quiet, for His Voice is heard in stillness. And His Judgement comes to all who stand aside in quiet listening, and wait for Him. </p>

<p>You who are sometimes sad and sometimes angry; who sometimes feel your just due is not given you, and your best efforts meet with lack of appreciation and even with contempt; give up these foolish thoughts. They are too small and meaningless to occupy your holy minds an instant longer. God’s Judgement waits for you to set you free. What can the world hold out to you, regardless of your judgements on its gifts, that you would rather have? You will be judged, and judged in fairness and in honesty. There is no deceit in God. His promises are sure. Only remember that. His promises have guaranteed His judgement, and His alone, will be accepted in the end. It is your function to make that end be soon. It is your function to hold it in your heart, and offer it to all the world to keep it safe.</p>
