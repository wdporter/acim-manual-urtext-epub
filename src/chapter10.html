<p>Changes are required in the minds of Godʹs teachers. This may or may not involve changes in the external situation. Remember that no one is where he is by accident, and chance plays no part in Godʹs plan. It is most unlikely that changes in his attitudes would not be the first step in the newly‐made teacher of Godʹs training. There is, however, no set pattern, since training is always highly individualised. There are those who are called upon to change their life situation almost immediately, but these are generally special cases. By far the majority are given a slowly evolving training program, in which as many previous mistakes as possible are corrected. Relationships in particular must be properly perceived, and all dark cornerstones of unforgiveness removed. Otherwise the old thought‐system still has a basis for return. </p>

<p>As the teacher of God advances in his training, he learns one lesson with increasing thoroughness. He does not make his own decisions; he asks his Teacher for His answer, and it is this he follows as his guide for action. This becomes easier and easier, as the teacher of God learns to give up his own judgement. The giving up of judgement, the obvious prerequisite for hearing Godʹs Voice, is usually a fairly slow process, not because it is difficult, but because it is apt to be perceived as personally insulting. The worldʹs training is directed toward achieving a goal in direct opposition to that of our curriculum. The world trains for reliance on oneʹs judgement as the criterion for maturity and strength. Our curriculum trains for the relinquishment of judgement as the necessary condition of salvation.</p>
